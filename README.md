### Background, Aim, and Scope

The Unix shell is the _de facto_ choice for specifying succinct and simple scripts for system orchestration, automation, and data ingestion. Ops trends in containerizaton and the cloud have brought shell scripting back to prominence, and thus motivate research of both theoretical and practical significance. The aim of this [HotOS'21](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/) Panel is to provide a forum for the discussion of new, renewed, and continued research in this area.

The focus will be on topics related to shell scripts and their runtime environments, and includes:

* Implementations and performance
* Parallelism and distribution
* Containerization, serverless, and microservices
* Tool support for the shell: analysis, transformation, and synthesis
* Annotations and type systems for tool support
* Mechanization and correctness
* Benchmarks and tools

The concrete topics of the panel will be informed by the interests of the panel's participants. We'll produce a summary of the event: participants will be able to contribute their perspectives and visions to the summary.

### (Possible) Format(s)

We are in the process of deciding on the panel's format, depending on the feedback/ideas we receive from panelists and attendees. Here are a few different formats we are considering

* Challenge problems: each panelist provides a challenge problem related to the shell and Ops; each discussed

* Formal panel: panelists provide a statement, pre-arranged prompts/questions from the audience

* Discussion tables: rotate between randomized rooms, given topics/prompts

* Hybrid: short statements + prompts from a few folks, then discussed in randomized groups

* Topic tables: Each table is assigned a research direction and participants move between them

### Panelists

Confirmed: 

* Arjun Guha (Northeastern University)
* Diomidis Spinellis (Athens University of Economics and Business; Delft University of Technology)
* Deepti Raghavan (Stanford University)

### Participants

We have confirmed 6 participants (updated Jan. 14)
