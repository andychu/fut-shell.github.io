### Background, Aim, and Scope

The Unix shell is the _de facto_ choice for specifying succinct and simple scripts for system orchestration, automation, and data ingestion. A few different trends in containerizaton and the cloud have brought shell scripting back to prominence, and thus motivate research of both theoretical and practical significance. The aim of this [HotOS'21](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/) Panel is to provide a forum for the discussion of new, renewed, and continued research in this area.

The focus will be on topics related to shell scripts and their runtime environments, and includes:

* Implementations and performance
* Parallelism and distribution
* Analysis, transformation, and synthesis
* Annotations and type systems
* Containerization, serverless, and microservices
* Mechanization and correctness
* Benchmarks and tools

The topics will be informed by the interests of the panel's participants.

### (Possible) Format(s)

We are in the process of deciding on the panel's format, depending on the feedback/ideas we receive from panelists and attendees. Here are a few different formats we are considering

* Formal panel: statement + prompts, no more than 5 organizers

* Discussion tables: rotate between randomized rooms, given topics/prompts

* Hybrid: short statements + prompts from a few folks, then discussed in randomized groups

* Topic tables: Each table is assigned a research direction and participants move between them


### Panelists

Confirmed panelists: 

* Arjun Guha (Northeastern University)
* Deepti Raghavan (Stanford University)

### Participants

We have confirmed 6 participants (updated Jan. 14)
