The goal of this [HotOS'21](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/) panel to explore and highlight future avenues for research in the context of the shell, informed by both industry and academia---across various academic communities including systems, programming languages, software engineering, security, and human-computer interaction.
We envision this panel as a round-table discussion between panelists and participants, which include many authors of shell-related technologies — _e.g._, popular and niche shells, static analysis for the shell, secure shell scripting languages, automated shell script parallelization, shell semantics, etc.
We anticipate minimal distinction between panelists and participants in the discussion:
  panelists will provide brief statements (~2min) about the future and/or challenges of the shell to get the discussion started, and will facilitate the discussion in various ways.
We'll have some iterated discussion in a few themed rooms, shuffling once or twice to let people explore different topics.

Attendees will have the ability to participate in "webinar" format, some way for them to ask questions, get them upvoted or whatever.
These questions and the discussion will be moderated by the organizers. 
To attend, [please register with HotOS](https://web.cvent.com/event/ea21de2e-ff68-470b-8b09-743b6572c469/).

### Background, Aim, and Scope

The Unix shell is the _de facto_ choice for specifying succinct and simple scripts for system orchestration, automation, and data ingestion. Ops trends in containerization and the cloud have brought shell scripting back to prominence, and thus motivate research of both theoretical and practical significance. The aim of this [HotOS'21](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/hotos/2021/) Panel is to provide a forum for the discussion of new, renewed, and continued research in this area.

The focus will be on topics related to shell scripts and their runtime environments, and includes:

* Implementations and performance
* Parallelism and distribution
* Containerization, serverless, and microservices
* Tool support for the shell: analysis, transformation, and synthesis
* Annotations and type systems for tool support
* Mechanization and correctness
* Benchmarks and tools

The concrete topics of the panel will be informed by the interests of the panel's participants. We'll produce a summary of the event: participants will be able to contribute their perspectives and visions to the summary.

### (Possible) Format(s)

We are in the process of deciding on the panel's format, depending on the feedback/ideas we receive from panelists and attendees. Here are a few different formats we are considering

* Challenge problems: each panelist provides a challenge problem related to the shell and Ops; each discussed

* Formal panel: panelists provide a statement, pre-arranged prompts/questions from the audience

* Discussion tables: rotate between randomized rooms, given topics/prompts

* Hybrid: short statements + prompts from a few folks, then discussed in randomized groups

* Topic tables: Each table is assigned a research direction and participants move between them

### Structure

We have already confirmed the following panelists:

* Arjun Guha (Northeastern; author of POSH)
* Diomidis Spinellis (AUEB \& TU Delft)
* Deepti Raghavan (Stanford; author of POSH)

Participants include 
Andy Chu
Carol Alexandru
Chet Ramey
Christos Dimoulas
Jiasi Shen
Julia Lawall
Jürgen Cito
Keith Winstein
Michał J Gajda
Ruzica Piskac
